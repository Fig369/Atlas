      <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;About Me</h1>
      <p class="center">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family migrated to united states from
        El Salvador back in the 80's escaping a civil war, I am a first
        generation Salvadorian American, and I never took advantage of schooling
        when I was younger so now Iâ€™m trying my best to push myself past my
        boundaries and comfort zone. I know there is a lot of knowledge out
        there and I want to learn as much as I can in my lifetime and hopefully
        apply those skills for something greater than myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came across TheClubhou.se accidently
        from my brother-in-law who moved down here with my from NY with his
        family and have then decided that since I was coming down for a fresh
        start that this program wis aligned which my current interest in life as
        far as a career in being a developer. The Clubhou.se seemed like the
        perfect investment in myself to learn how to program to implement these
        skills to build a standard web application from the front-end design to
        back-end data management to start my journey as a Web Developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I go thru the journey of becoming a Web
        Developer I plan on using those skill to help contribute to a DAO
        Project I am currently involved in that is on the Stellar Blockchain
        called THE JPEG DAO where the members collaborate to provide the
        community with amazing NFT experiences!
